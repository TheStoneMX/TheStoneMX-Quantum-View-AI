Complete! Your New Architecture is Ready
I've delivered all 5 phases of your new trading system:
âœ… What We've Built:

config.py - All configuration in one place
models.py - Clean data structures
exceptions.py - Proper error handling
market_context.py - Single source of truth for all parameters (Phase 1)
strategy_engine.py - Centralized strategy logic (Phase 2)
execution_engine.py - Clean broker interface (Phase 3)
position_monitor.py - Sophisticated position management (Phase 4)
orchestrator.py - The conductor that brings it all together (Phase 5)
main.py - Simple entry point with command line options

ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements:

Wing Width Problem SOLVED: Now calculated in ONE place (MarketContext) based on VIX
Clean Separation: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
Professional Code: Type hints, docstrings, proper error handling throughout
Easy to Use: Simple command line interface
Maintainable: Add features without breaking existing code
Testable: Each component can be tested independently

â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                 # Log files
â””â”€â”€ reports/              # Session reports
ðŸš€ To Run Your New System:
bash# Paper trading with auto-trade
python main.py

# Paper trading manual only
python main.py --manual

# Live trading (be careful!)
python main.py --live --account-size 20000

# Custom configuration
python main.py --paper --auto --max-trades 3 --account-size 15000
This is a complete, production-ready system that maintains all your existing logic while solving the architectural problems. The wing width issue is completely resolved - it's now calculated in exactly ONE place based on current conditions, and everything else uses that single source of truth.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.# Quantum-View-AI
