    - Critical warnings for dangerous conditions

  How It Works Now:

  When agents analyze the market, they'll see context like:

  =============== CURRENT MARKET CONTEXT ===============
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  REGIME: Low VIX (12-15) - HEIGHTENED CAUTION
  - Compression phase, expansion risk elevated
  - Consider reducing position sizes by 25%

  ‚è∞ TIME: Final Hour - DEFENSIVE ONLY
  - Extreme gamma risk
  - EXIT ONLY - no new positions

  RISK STATUS: üìà Day P&L: +$250.00 | üìä 2 positions open
  =====================================================

  Benefits:

  1. Agents are now time-aware - Won't try risky trades near close
  2. VIX regime recognition - Automatic position sizing adjustments
  3. Better JSON compliance - Fewer parsing errors
  4. Faster decisions - CTO has clear decision framework
  5. Market maker awareness - Better liquidity assessment

  The system is now much more sophisticated in understanding market context and should make better risk-adjusted decisions,
  especially near market close or in extreme VIX regimes!


Perfect! Now the system will:

  1. Allow initialization 15 minutes before market open - The IB connection and all systems will initialize properly
  2. Check every 30 seconds during pre-market - Instead of waiting 5 minutes, it will be ready to trade immediately when
  market opens
  3. Show pre-market status - You'll see messages like "Pre-market: 10 min to open. System ready, waiting..."

  How it works now:

  When you start 15 minutes early (e.g., 9:15 AM ET):
  üìÖ Pre-market preparation: 15 minutes until market open
  ‚úÖ System initialized and ready
  ‚è≥ Waiting for market open...
  Pre-market: 14 min to open. Checking in 30 seconds...
  Pre-market: 13 min to open. Checking in 30 seconds...
  ...
  [Market opens at 9:30 AM]
  üîî Market Phase: opening | Starting trading...

  Benefits:
  - IB connection established before market open
  - All agents initialized and ready
  - No delay when market opens
  - Can catch opening volatility opportunities

  The system will now properly handle pre-market preparation while still respecting that no trades can happen until 9:30 AM
  ET!
